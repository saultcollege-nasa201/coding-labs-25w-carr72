The reason is that it is not safe for a server to trust data received from a form, even if client-side JavaScript was used to validate the data. Because a malicious user can disable the JavaScript or manipulate the client -side code by bypassing your validation. They can also use browser developer tools for creating their own HTTP requests. These techniques allow malicious users to send invalid or malicious data directly to the server, potentially leading to various security vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, command injection, and data manipulation. The malicious user can input an JavaScript file into the form that can capture all of the information that was entered into the form by doing so they can receive all of the username passwords or anything that was entered in the form and then use it for bad stuff why is not it is not safe.
